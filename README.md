# Biodiversity_Bacteria
In this project, I am creating customizable and dynamic visulization of Biodiversity Bacteria through autonomous JavaScript and HTML scripts. 

## **Overview**
This project brings an overview of how individual volunteers were assesed based on the bacteria in their belly that can help transform and create synthetic beef. While this may sound bit odd and weird its actually quite intriguing to find that belly button bacteria can help scientist in their research.
