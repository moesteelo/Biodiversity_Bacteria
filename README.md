# Biodiversity_Bacteria
In this project, I am creating customizable and dynamic visulization of Biodiversity Bacteria through JavaScript and HTML scripts. 

## **Overview**
This project presents three data charts that display bacteria samples. The Test Subject ID NO: is a drop-down menu within the dashboard that allows you to select a volunteers id number which shows you basic information of the volunteer. The interactive charts will then update with the bacteria sample data allowing for a further dynamic visualization.
